# Contributing to Canvas Designer

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Canvas Designer as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs and feature requests. Report a bug or suggest a feature by opening a new issue.

#### Bug Reports

When filing a bug report, please include:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or things you tried that didn't work)

### Coding Style

* Use TypeScript for type safety
* Follow the existing code style
* Write meaningful commit messages
* Comment your code where necessary
* Write tests for new features
